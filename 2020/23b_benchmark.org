* Advent of Code 2020 Day 23
  Perfect puzzle to show differences between interpreted, JIT and compiled
  language. The same solution was written in two languages -- Python and C.
  Python code was run on CPython and PyPy implementation. C code was compiled
  with optimization turned on. Benchmark ran on i5 3210M Win10 using Cygwin.
